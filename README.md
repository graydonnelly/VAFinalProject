# The Kronos Incident 

We built our system based on the data from Mini-Challenge 2 of the 2021 VAST challenge, which contains the geospatial and transaction data of GAStech employees. Its purpose is to assist the officers of the Abila Police Department in their investigation of the disappearance of GAStech employees by the visualization of employee activities in order to locate places of interest.

## The Visualizations 

Officers running cc_vis.py will be able to view a   visualization of employee credit card transactions. A map of Abila displays where GAStech employees spent money at in the given timeframe, with larger circles indicating more money spent. 

There will also be a visualization in business_view.py that allows the officer to view a map of Abila and click on a specific business in order to view information regarding its customers and transactions. 

A visualization for the geolocation data will allow the officer to view the routes taken by GAStech employees.
